# ALU_project
This project provides an 8-bit ALU written in plain Verilog, complete with a self-checking testbench and VCD waveform dump. You can compile and simulate it immediately, observe signal transitions in any VCD-capable viewer, and use the ready-made testbench to verify functionality before integrating into your FPGA or ASIC flow.
